Instruction to open and run files in Colaboratory:

- On top of every file there's a link button that will open the file directly in Colaboratory. 
- Once in Colaboratory environment press Ctrl+F9 to run all.


Instructions for run main files correctily:

1. Firstly, open and run in Colaboratory the following files stored in "functions" folder:

    - MultilayerPerceptron.ipynb : this file contains a function that generates the multilayer perceptron.
    - PostProcessing_SlidingWindows.ipynb : this file contains the silding windows function for post-processing purpose.
    - CookingInstanceModality.ipynb : this file contains a function that computes the intersections between real instances of cooking and
                                      predicted instances of cooking. It also provides the computing of some metrics such as recall,                                             precision and f1-score.
    - Utils.ipynb : this file contains a function useful to compute confusion matrices and metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision 
                     and f1-score.
                                       
2. Now you can choose to run model1.ipynb (to perform a one-shot validation) or model1_cross_validation.ipynb (to perforn a cross-validation).

The dataset can be freely used for non-commercial research purposes. All
use of the data must cite the respective paper:
